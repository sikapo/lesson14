Animal Farm is a beast fable, in the form of a satirical allegorical novella, by George Orwell, first published in
England on 17 August 1945. It tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic farm animals who rebel against their human
farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is
betrayed, and under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon, the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before.
According to Orwell, Animal Farm reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the
Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile
to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona May Days
conflicts between the POUM and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell
described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin ("un conte satirique contre Staline"), and in his essay
"Why I Write" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he
was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".
